## Project Overview
- The project aims to develop and evaluate predictive models for estimating healthcare costs for individuals using a Medical Cost Personal (Insurance) dataset.
- By leveraging regression models, the project seeks to provide insights into the factors contributing to higher healthcare charges and improve the accuracy of cost estimates.



## Motivation
- The healthcare sector faces increasing complexity in managing medical data and optimizing healthcare delivery.
- Predictive models offer the potential to assist healthcare providers, insurers, and policymakers in identifying high-risk patients and optimizing resource allocation.
- Pairing healthcare data with regression models can lead to better forecasting of health insurance charges, aiding individuals in understanding and planning for their healthcare expenses.



### Aim & Objectives
- **Aim:** 
	- The aim of this project is to develop and evaluate predictive regression models for estimating healthcare costs based on individual characteristics and medical history.
- **Objectives:** 
  	- To preprocess the Medical Cost Personal (Insurance) dataset, ensuring data accuracy and completeness.
	- To identify key factors influencing healthcare charges, such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and medical history.
	- To develop and evaluate at least two regression models (linear regression and random forest regression) for estimating healthcare costs.
	- To assess the suitability of the selected models based on performance metrics.
	- To contribute to the growing literature on predictive modeling in healthcare and provide insights into the most suitable models for the Medical Cost Personal Dataset.
